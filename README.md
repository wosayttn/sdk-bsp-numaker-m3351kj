Notice:
(1) Please install Nu-Link_Keil_Driver for development.

## 3. Program firmware

### Step 1

At first, you need to configure switch on the NuMaker board. Set the four switches to ‘ON’ position. After the configuration is done, connect the NuMaker board and your computer using the USB Type-C cable. After that, window manager will show a ‘NuMicro MCU’ virtual disk. Finally, you will use this virtual disk to burn firmware.

### Step 2

A simple firmware burning method is that you can drag and drop the binary image file to NuMicro MCU virtual disk or copy the binary file to NuMicro MCU disk to burn firmware.

## 4. Test

You can use Tera Term terminate emulator (or other software) to type commands of RTT. All parameters of serial communication are shown in below image. Here, you can find out the corresponding port number of Nuvoton Virtual Com Port in window device manager.
